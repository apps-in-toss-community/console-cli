# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Discover the real Toss developer console OAuth authorize URL, client id, and scopes so `ait-console login` can work without the `AIT_CONSOLE_OAUTH_URL` override. The callback server + state + browser-open + session-write scaffold is in place; what's missing is the outbound endpoint. Track in CLAUDE.md § "Open questions".
- [ ] Replace the placeholder "callback query carries user_id/email/display_name" path in `login` with a real token-exchange + Playwright `storageState` capture once the OAuth endpoint is known. `src/commands/login.ts` around the `query.raw.user_id ?? query.code` line.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement `ait-console deploy [path]` — headless Playwright driving the console's deploy flow with the stored session. Include `--dry-run` from day one.
- [ ] Implement `ait-console logs [--tail]` — scrape/stream logs from the console.
- [ ] Implement `ait-console status` — app status and last-deploy summary.
- [ ] Wire SHA-256 verification into `ait-console upgrade` — download `SHA256SUMS` from the release, verify the binary before atomic replace (currently only `install.sh` verifies). `src/commands/upgrade.ts` ~L135.
- [ ] Wire smoke test after upgrade — re-exec the new binary with `--version` before considering the upgrade successful.
- [ ] Clean up stale `<exePath>.old` files on Windows boot (currently left behind after self-upgrade).
- [ ] Audit `--json` error paths — `src/commands/upgrade.ts` writes JSON errors to stdout while plain errors go to stderr; the CLAUDE.md contract wants **diagnostics on stderr always**, with only the structured result on stdout.
- [ ] Run the first 0.1.x binary release pipeline end-to-end — exercise Changesets "Version Packages" PR → npm publish → `release-binaries.yml` matrix → `SHA256SUMS` upload → `install.sh` pull → `ait-console upgrade` roundtrip on at least one real platform.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Self-host the CLI docs (alongside the `docs` repo or as a subpath).
- [ ] Extend `install.sh` platform coverage — `/tmp` fallback when `$HOME` is unset, and exponential-backoff retry (up to 30 s) on 404 during the release-asset upload race. (`sha256sum` fallback, root-owned prior-install detection, and `AIT_CONSOLE_QUIET=1` are already implemented.)

## Performance
(None)

## Backlog
- [ ] OS keychain session storage (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Secret Service) behind a flag — blocked by `bun build --compile` not bundling native deps like `keytar` cleanly across platforms. Can be added later without migrating data: move `cookies`/`origins` into the keychain, keep the rest in `session.json`.
- [ ] `ait-console mcp` — expose the same ops as an MCP stdio server. Deferred per the umbrella MCP strategy matrix.
- [ ] macOS binary signing / notarization — users currently `chmod +x` and `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` if Gatekeeper complains. Proper notarization is a 1.0 item.
- [ ] Homebrew tap (`brew install apps-in-toss-community/tap/ait-console`).
- [ ] Plugin system, multi-account switching, release-notes generation — out of scope for 0.1.x; gated behind explicit `minor`/`major` approval.
